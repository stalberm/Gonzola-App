        SAVANT TUTORS Our tutors are drawn from an exclusive group of teaching
        professionals from around the world. Our entry requirements are
        extremely strict; we source our colleagues from the most prestigious
        institutions. Our tutors must have at least one degree from one of the
        top ten universities in the world (according to Shanghai school
        rankings) and/or are part of the top ten academic programs in their
        discipline. They are highly esteemed in their fields of expertise
        everywhere. But that’s not all. In addition to notable degrees, our
        tutors are well-respected teachers with proven classroom excellence. We
        use PROT (peer-review-of-teaching) evaluations as well as student
        evaluations to vet our tutors. Most of them have won multiple teaching
        awards.

        PROFESSIONAL SAVANTS SEMINARS The professional SAVANTS seminars are
        designed to provide actual, accountable results and real value at a
        fast-paced rhythm. Our professional students have excelled in their
        careers so far, but now need to more fully master a particular subject
        (usually a foreign language, but sometimes a specific aspect of
        business). Typically sponsored by companies directly, the SAVANTS
        SEMINARS are always custom built around the particular needs students or
        small groups. These courses engage business-related issues and practices
        from the very first meeting.
