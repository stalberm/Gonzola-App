        SAVANTS IN CONVERSATION
        <br />
        From intermediate to advanced, at SAVANTS, we offer conversation courses
        in almost any language to students of all ages almost anywhere on Earth.
        As much as we value online communications, we make every effort to offer
        such courses in a person-to-person mode. What makes our conversation
        courses unique and different, besides the incomparable quality of our
        tutors, is the opportunity to move beyond confident chit-chat to fully
        competency in reading and writing as well. Even when kept light, such
        skills constitute an important part of our courses. The overall
        confidence gained by our students leads to increased competencies in
        language fundamentals, which leads organically to more sophisticated and
        nuanced communicative techniques and tactics.
