                SAVANT TUTORS
                <br />
                Our tutors are drawn from an exclusive group of teaching professionals from around
                the world. Our entry requirements are extremely strict; we source our colleagues
                from the most prestigious institutions. Our tutors must have at least one degree from
                one of the top ten universities in the world (according to Shanghai school rankings)
                and/or are part of the top ten academic programs in their discipline. They are highly
                esteemed in their fields of expertise everywhere. But that's not all. In addition to
                notable degrees, our tutors are well-respected teachers with proven classroom
                excellence. We use PROT (peer-review-of-teaching) evaluations as well as student
                evaluations to vet our tutors. Most of them have won multiple teaching awards.

                Distinguished executives from top companies and world renowned, award-winning
                professionals in artistic and creative fields are part of our network as well. Their
                wealth of knowledge and their generous desire to share their experiences constitute
                the pillars of our network.

                Short and simple: our pledge is to put the very best teachers in the world at your
                service, for a unique and exclusive tutoring experience.

                Like our faculty, our students are curious, enthusiastic, and committed. They are
                ethically-engaged citizens of the world looking to broaden their knowledge without
                the hassle and cost of matriculation. They are kids and retirees, full-time parents and
                business professionals. They are military service people and ordinary folk who have a
                thirst for new knowledge and a passion to explore new avenues of wisdom.
