                PROFESSIONAL SAVANTS SEMINARS
                <br />
                The professional SAVANTS seminars are designed to provide actual, accountable
                results and real value at a fast-paced rhythm.

                Our professional students have excelled in their careers so far, but now need to
                more fully master a particular subject (usually a foreign language, but sometimes a
                specific aspect of business). Typically sponsored by companies directly, the
                SAVANTS SEMINARS are always custom built around the particular needs
                students or small groups. These courses engage business-related issues and
                practices from the very first meeting.
                
                It's one thing to leisurely flip through a language app while on vacation. But
                clearly and effortlessly communicating with clients in a foreign language during an
                important business exchange is something else entirely.

                From correctly comprehending casual conversations to discussing
                multi-million-dollar contracts, an international professional's foreign language
                expertise must also include a confident cross-cultural capacity. A fully competent
                toolbox of communicative and culturally-informed tactics are now crucial to
                brokering successful transactions. Our trained tutors can help you navigate not
                only grammar and vocabulary but also the cultural insights you need to
                successfully operate in a global context.
                                
                Beyond strengthening language proficiencies, other students within this
                professional category may want to brush up on their marketing, sales, or
                accounting skills. These students often come to us after taking on a higher
                position within their organizations, which requires increased expertise in a
                particular area.
                                
                At SAVANTS we not only manage to customize our learning programs to your
                specific professional learning need, but we also adapt to your busy schedules as
                well, beginning with your first master class.
